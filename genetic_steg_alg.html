                                    <p> Steganography is the science of hiding information. Unlike encryption which focuses on hiding the contents of information, steganography focuses on hiding the very existance of information. In many use cases, knowing that a message was even sent and the fact that it was encrypted is a big leak of information, even if the contents remain unbroken. Steganography see's its most common use today in digital water-marking. This technology helps confirm the authenticity of a file, (ex: checking if a file is pirated). </p>
                                    <p>    
                                    Steganographic algorithms work by embeding a message into a host file. Tampering any file requires flipping bits which in turn result in some noise being produced in the medium. A portion of a picture may become fuzzy or an audio file may have some white noise added to it. <b>The goal of this project is to design an algorithm that minimizes this noise. </b>

                                        Finding the absolute minimal noise requires trying to flip every n-permutation of bits in a host file(n is the size of the message) . Since even a one minute of audio contains over 8 million bits, this quickly becomes computationally infeasable.

                                        What we need is a search heuristic which intelligently searches the space of solutions and finds one that is reasonable. In the context of our problem, our algorithm wont produce the absolute minimum noise possible, but it will find a reasonably good solution, not take weeks to compute, and scale quickly - a pretty good tradeoff.

The noise produced will be the inverse of our fitness function; the chromosome that produces the least noise has the highest fitness. But we still need some mathamatical way to represent the noise produced. A common metric for measuring quality of a media file is the signal to noise ration (SNR) which is defined as:
                                    
                                    \[SNR = \frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}} = \frac{SignalRMS_{voltage}}{NoiseRMS_{voltage}}\]

                                    Simply put, this function measures the noise in a medium by comparing the noisy file with the baseline file (before the message was added). Its commonly used in electrical engineering to measure how well a signal is transferred. The details can be found in the file StegoLib.py.

                                    <p>Rank selection would sort all the chromsomes in terms of fitness and assign probabilties depending on each chromosomes rank in that sorted list. This would result in the best chromosome having a slight edge over the second best chromosome which would have a slight edge over the N-2 chromosome etc.</p>

                   <p>To simulate the spinning of a roulette wheel, a pseudo-random threshold is picked. Random chromosomes are selected and their fitnesses are added together until the cumulated weight exceeds the threshold; the last chromosome is selected. Although all chromosomes have an equal probability of selection, the probability that a chromosome is the final one is directly proportional to its fitness, and thus simulates a weighted distribution. </p>

                        <p>Crossover is the process of merging two chromosomes together. In the context of our stegonograpy problem, we are merging two lists which contain various points in a file. The goal is that the indicies which hide are less prone to noise are megered, leaving behind the more noisy indicies. My implementation takes a random point in the one chromosome and copies everything after that point into the second chromosome. I could have created the new chromosome through the process of setting many different breakpoints and shuffling. This would have increased diversity and expanded the search space, but I wanted to benchmark a simple crossover function first. Creating to much diversity in a simulation can lead to randomness.</p>

                        <p>Testing the algorithm multiple times on many different messages and .wav files shows that it is capable of finding locally optimal indicies. In this particular example, the algorithm was run for 20 generations, and the best value for each generation was strictly increasing most generations. After a certain point all the chromosomes became idenetical and it converged. If no evolution was taking place, we would expect the best values for each generation to be random with no clear pattern. </p>

After setting up a few experiments to tune the parameters, my algorithm began showing evolution. </p>
                        
                        <p> I chose to work on steganography because current algorithms are very easily broken using statistical analysis. A long running joke is the printing of Sony's keys across shirts. My project was a proof of concept, using one kind of evolutionary algorithm to show evolution across only one metric. Much more work needs to be done, specifically in comparing the data leakage from statistical tools across standard algorithms like least significant bit and lapalce transform. </p>
